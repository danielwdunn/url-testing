# url-testing
A simple Python script and collection of URLs to test URL filtering and blocking. The primary use case is to test accessibility and censorship at public libraries. The master list is modified and derived from a list generated by the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society: https://github.com/berkmancenter/url-lists/tree/master/lists
